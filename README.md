# CookiesInLA-SalesForecasting

My completed sales forecasting predictive analysis for Cookies In LA using brand and product features from 2017-2021 to predict the total monthly sales per brand and product. I cleaned and wrangled the data, using various imputation strategies, and augmented multiple time series (such as Rolling Averages) and product level features (such as variety of flavors per brand). I then trained linear regression and random forest models to the data and ran statistical analysis to what time of year is the best launch date for products.

I worked with Aditya Mishra on the project.
